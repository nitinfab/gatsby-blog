When I write stories on Medium, everything I believe is to attract readers, followers, claps, and more views.

But it is an outcome.

More precisely, It is an outcome that needs helpful content that readers read, enjoy, etc. The main factor for these is quality content, unique title, and an image.

Besides the title, Images help readers to click a specific story.
And mostly every writer uses Unsplash Images for their content.

But do you know, Unsplash is acquired by Getty? Yes, it is true.

Before proceeding further, let me explain more about Unsplash.

## What is actually Unsplash?

Unsplash is a website used to download free photos in any category. Actually, it consists of more than 1 million photographs with more than 1 billion images downloaded by its customer. 

Mikael Cho got the idea to create a platform to share images freely with the entire world. So he created a platform named Unsplash.

Besides Unsplash, Mikael Cho was also cofounder at Crew.

## How it became viral?

Unsplash main motive is to allow creators to share their work with the online world. But creators can not able to earn a single penny from Unsplash.
Since creators are not making money with Unsplash. Unsplash used to provide free photos to everyone.

That’s the main reason for Unsplash success. Platforms like Medium, Vocal, Ghost, etc tried to use Unsplash. This lead Unsplash to become viral.

Even you can access Unsplash photos on your website through Unsplash API. [Here ](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-create-react-image-gallery-web-app-using-unsplash-api-9eda5aa0f325)is a complete guide for that.

The intention to help creators and provide free photos to everyone is the main reason for Unsplash success.

## Competitors of Unsplash

Unsplash was launched in 2013. Before that, Shutterstock, Freepik was launched.
Even Pexels was founded in 2014. Pexels even allow downloading free videos to use.
Similarly, Pixabay works. 

And there are many other platforms as well. But they were not successful as Unsplash.

The most giant competitor is Canva. Canva allows us to create Videos, Photos, Logos, Infographics, Book cover, Books, Posters, reports, Planner, Business Proposals, Flyer, Blog graphics, and many more.

## How Unsplash Earn Money?

Many a time when I use Unsplash, I search about their source of money. Since they don’t sell photos, even don’t use Google Ads.

I got a lot of ideas, content about it like from [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/unsplash-for-brands/#:~:text=Unsplash%20is%20building%20an%20ad%20business%20around%20branded%20stock%20photos,-Anthony%20Ha%40anthonyha&text=Unsplash%20has%20built%20up%20a,available%20to%20use%20for%20free.&text=Square%2C%20for%20example%2C%20could%20upload,cash%20register%E2%80%9D%20and%20other%20terms.), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-does-unsplash-com-make-money). But I want to know more.

Then I got the information from [Unsplash Blog](https://medium.com/unsplash/introducing-unsplash-for-brands-3b60d1b4ad0c). In simple terms, Unsplash will work with brands like Google, Square, Boxed Water, Le Creuset, etc.

## Unsplash is acquired by Getty

On March 30, 2021, Mikael Cho announced that [Unsplash is acquired by Getty Images](https://unsplash.com/blog/unsplash-getty/).

Mikael Cho wrote that —

I’m excited to share that Unsplash is being acquired by Getty Images today.

The reason I’m excited about this acquisition is that it’s not goodbye, it’s about acceleration.

This is not one of those tech acquisitions where the company is bought to be shut down. Unsplash will continue to operate as a standalone brand and division of Getty Images. 

The entire Unsplash team will be staying and building Unsplash in the direction we have been. The main difference now is we have access to the resources and experience of Getty Images to help accelerate our plans to create the world’s most useful visual asset library.

It clarifies their intention about Unsplash. Unsplash will continue to operate as a single identity and division of Getty Images.

And it will remain free for users.

Lastly,

How much Getty Images paid to Mikael Cho? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsplash#:~:text=In%20March%202021%2C%20Unsplash%20was,Images%20with%20Cho%20in%20charge.), Unsplash was acquired by Getty Images for an undisclosed sum.

That's it--Thanks!
