All it was started because of one of mine friend.

My friend(4 years older than me) has been working in a top MNC. And I want to know the trick to get accepted in top MNCâ€™s.

So I called him to know the strategies.

**Me**: What I have to do to get hired?

**My friend**: Learn and then implement it.

**Me**: What does it mean?

**My friend**: Let me describe to you briefly. Suppose you are learning Web development, you will not be going to be hired. If you learned every concept then also you will not be going to be hired.

**Me**: Then what I have to do?

**My friend**: Create something out of your skill. I mean to say that if you learned Web development then create a blog, a portfolio website, an app, software, or anything else. This will helps the recruiter to know that other than learning you can also implement something out of it.

So this way my journey of Web development started. And from that, I have learned that Blog posts and YouTube can make you a Web Developer.
